***Tech stack***: GoLang, Postgres, OpenAPI, Heroku

***DISCLAIMER***: This was a small project to start learning and working with GoLang. So every code you see here was the first lines of code that I wrote in GoLang so be mindful of this.

This is an REST API to track your stock investments. With this API you can have your portfolio, with all the transactions history, current stocks, past stocks, market values, percentages, profit, loss, etc. The idea of this API was actually to be used aftewards on a webapp. This ideia got dumped for now but I might catch it later.
